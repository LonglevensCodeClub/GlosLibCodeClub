Longlevens Library Code Club
============================

Longlevens Library Code Club is part of [CodeClub.org](https://codeclub.org). The club is aimed at children between the age of 9 and 13 years old who want to learn how to write computer programs. The club will accept children outside of this age range if they have the interest and willingness to learn.

For more details and how to book places, please see [Information for Parents](ParentsInfoSheet.pdf)

If your child or children are already participating in our Code Club, please see [Coding@Home](CodingAtHome.pdf) for how they can carry on their Code Club activities at home.
