Longlevens Library Code Club
============================

Longlevens Library Code Club is part of [CodeClub.org](https://codeclub.org). The club is aimed at children between the age of 9 and 13 years old who want to learn how to write computer programs. The club will accept children outside of this age range if they have the interest and willingness to learn.

Coronavirus - Suspension of Library Events
------------------------------------------

Unfortunately due to the CoronaVirus outbreak, the Code Club sessions at the library have had to be suspended until further notice. However, children can still participate from home using the instructions at [Coding@Home](CodingAtHome.pdf) if they have access to a computer and the Internet at home. These instructions detail how children can access the projects they have already created at the library and how to access Scratch and Trinket online to continue their work.

GitHub may look daunting at first, but you do not need an account to access any files or worry about all the various tabs and buttons which the volunteers use to update the content. Using with the link provided in [Coding@Home](CodingAtHome.pdf), just click on either "Coders" or "Exercises" which will take you to the relevant folders and files. Some files such as Scratch project files (filename ending with .sb2) will not show in the browser. In this case it will not be possible to cut and paste content and the message "View Raw" will appear. Simply click the "Download" button just above on the right and the file will be saved onto your computer.

The club hopes to implement some form of online support for children trying the club's projects. If you create Scratch and Trinket accounts for your child/children then it will be possible to share projects with the volunteers who can then examine their code and provide feedback. Details on our to do this will be issued once we have worked out an easy to use technical solution that adheres to STEM Ambassador and Code Club safe guarding rules.
