Longlevens Library Code Club
============================
Longlevens Library Code Club is part of [CodeClub.org](https://codeclub.org). The club is aimed at children between the age of 9 and 13 years old who want to learn how to write computer programs. The club will accept children outside of this age range if they have the interest and willingness to learn.

Coronavirus - Suspension of Library Events
------------------------------------------
Unfortunately due to the CoronaVirus outbreak, the Code Club sessions at the library have had to be suspended until further notice. The library itself is closed from 23 March 2020.

The Club is moving Online
-------------------------
We are going to be providing online support to children working at home (see below). Hopefully parents of recent attendees will have had an email from the library with details how to request support for their child or children. 

Parents who have responded to our email address contained in the message from the library should now all have had details of how to join us on online at 11:30am on 28 March 2020. If you have not received instructions or having difficulty getting online, please email us asap.

We are limited to attendees who recently attended the club who have been contacted by the GCC Library Service. Unfortunately the volunteers do not have access to contact details for parents. We hope with the help of the library service that we can extend the invite out to other parents in the coming weeks. In the meantime, all children can continue to access their work and carry on completing our exercises using the information below.

Coding@Home
-----------
Children can code at home whenever they like using the instructions in our [Coding@Home](CodingAtHome.pdf) document, providing they have access to a computer and the Internet at home. The instructions detail how children can access the projects they have already created at the library and how to access Scratch and Trinket online to continue their work.

GitHub where their files and our exercises are stored may look daunting at first, but you do not need a GitHub account to access any files or worry about all the various tabs and buttons which the volunteers use to update the contents. Using the link provided in the [Coding@Home](CodingAtHome.pdf) or the link on this page [View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/LonglevensCodeClub/GlosLibCodeClub), just click on either "Coders" or "Exercises" and navigate to the relevant folders and files just as if you were using a File Explorer window. (Children who have not attended Code Club for a long time may find their work has been saved in "Coders/Archive".)

Note some files such as Scratch project files (filenames ending with .sb2) will not show in your browser. In this case it will not be possible to cut and paste content and the message "View Raw" will appear. To obtain a copy of the file, simply click the "Download" button just above on the right and the file will be saved onto your computer where your browser normally saves downloads.
