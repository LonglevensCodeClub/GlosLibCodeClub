Longlevens Library Code Club
============================
Longlevens Library Code Club is part of [CodeClub.org](https://codeclub.org). The club is aimed at children between the age of 9 and 13 years old who want to learn how to write computer programs. The club will accept children outside of this age range if they have the interest and willingness to learn.

Coronavirus - Suspension of Library Events
------------------------------------------
Unfortunately due to the CoronaVirus outbreak, the Code Club sessions at the library have had to be suspended until further notice. The library itself is closed from 23 March 2020.

Carry On Coding@Home
--------------------
Children can still participate from home using the instructions in our [Coding@Home](CodingAtHome.pdf) document providing they have access to a computer and the Internet at home. The instructions detail how children can access the projects they have already created at the library and how to access Scratch and Trinket online to continue their work.

GitHub where their files and our exercises are stored may look daunting at first, but you do not need a GitHub account to access any files or worry about all the various tabs and buttons which the volunteers use to update the contents. Using the link provided in the [Coding@Home](CodingAtHome.pdf) or the link on this page [View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/LonglevensCodeClub/GlosLibCodeClub), just click on either "Coders" or "Exercises" and navigate to the relevant folders and files just as if you were using a File Explorer window. Note some files such as Scratch project files (filenames ending with .sb2) will not show in your browser. In this case it will not be possible to cut and paste content and the message "View Raw" will appear. To obtain a copy of the file, simply click the "Download" button just above on the right and the file will be saved onto your computer where your browser normally saves downloads.

The club hopes to implement some form of online support for children trying the club's projects. If you create Scratch and Trinket accounts for your child/children then it will be possible to share projects with the volunteers who can then examine their code and provide feedback. Details on how to do this will be issued once we have worked out an easy to use technical solution that adheres to STEM Ambassador and Code Club safe guarding rules.
