This project can be made advanced by changing the way the arrows are aimed:
1. Use the cursor keys to move the arrow around.
2. Add a random wobble to the arrow as the archer cannot stand perfectly still.
3. Change the firing code so that the arrow is fired immediately the space bar is pressed. (There is a delay as per the instructions.)
