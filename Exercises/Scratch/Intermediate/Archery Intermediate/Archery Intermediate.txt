Start by following the Archery beginner project instructions if you haven't done that project previously.

Then modify your code to do the following:

1. Use the cursor keys to move the arrow around before firing.

2. Add in a random wobble to the archer's aim as an archer cannot stand perfectly still.

3. Change the code for releasing the arrow so that the arrow is fired virtually immediately when the space bar is pressed.

4. Leave a mark on the target where an arrow has struck it so a player can see where their previous arrows hit the targe.

5. Add in the player's current score, number of arrows they have fired and a record of the highest score by any player.

6. Add in a "Game Over" message once all arrows in the player's turn have been fired.
