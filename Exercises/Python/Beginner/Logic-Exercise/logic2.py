# Exercise: Write two more questions:
#	* 'do you have a dog'
#   * 'have you been outside today'
# Then process the answers as suggested
#
# If the answer to both is yes then suggest
#	* 'take the dog for a walk'
# If you don't have a dog, but haven't been outside yet then suggest
#	* 'it would be nice to go for a walk'
# otherwise print out
#	* 'i'm glad you have had some fresh air'
